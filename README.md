This is a work in progress. Games are always a fun challenge as they very quickly <br>
become challenging works of logic. The premise for this game is Mine Sweeper style grid exploration <br>
combined with generic resource management similar to what is found in games like Settlers of Catan. <br>
Different types of lands will generate different types of resources which can be spent to <br>
build armies for attacking and defending, training explorers to claim and settle more lands, <br>
and any other features I can think of down the road that will be worth adding.

Currently this is an incredibly simple setup consisting of several javascript files (to break up code into smaller blocks). However it is entirely possible that later versions may use webpack or be converted to something more in the "virtual dom" way of doing things. For now, utter simplicity is the goal as my primary focus is to have the game logic rock solid.
